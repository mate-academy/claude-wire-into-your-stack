Summarize what changed.

The base branch is `$ARGUMENTS`. If that is empty, use `main`. Call it BASE below. If BASE starts with `-`, stop and say it isn't a valid branch name.

Run these git commands, substituting BASE for the base branch:

1. `git status --short`
2. `git diff HEAD --stat`
3. `git log --oneline BASE..HEAD`
4. `git diff BASE...HEAD --stat`

Read the actual diffs where the stats aren't enough, then reply with:

1. **Overview**: one or two sentences on the purpose of the changes, and which base you compared against.
2. **Changes**: a short bullet list grouped by area (routes, db, tests, config), naming the files.
3. **Uncommitted**: anything not yet committed, or "none".
4. **Watch out for**: risks, missing tests, or loose ends. Omit if there are none.

Keep it brief. Don't modify any files.
